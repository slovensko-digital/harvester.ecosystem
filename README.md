## Supported data sources

Currently, Harvester supports the following data-sources:

- [ITMS2014+](https://www.itms2014.sk/) 
- [Institutions with public e-desk](https://data.gov.sk/dataset/upvs-institucie-so-schrankou)

Currently, there are data sources in [ekosystem.slovensko.digital](https://ekosystem.slovensko.digital/)
which are not ingested by Harvester. The corresponding code hasn't been open-sourced yet.
 

## Development  

Harvester is a Ruby-on-Rails application. However, there is no web process present. The application
runs as a backend worker/scheduler and uses the Rails framework to enforce coding rules for the project. 

To get the Harvester dependencies running (db, etc), 
we have prepared a [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file for you. 
You can start the dependencies with `docker-compose up`.

To run and test the application while developing:

- Prepare the environment with `bin/setup`
- Ensure that all tests pass: `rake spec`
- Start the worker with `foreman start worker` 
- Run a selected job with rake
- Check that the corresponding database tables have been filled in
